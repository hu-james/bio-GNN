# bio-GNN
Reproducible graph neural network pipeline for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction 

## Project Goals
1. Understand and implement graph neural networks for drug discovery
2. Reproduce established scientific results from past publications
3. Build reproducible training and evaluation pipelines
4. Apply modern MLOps practices to scientific ML like experiment tracking, containerization, & automated testing
